<h2>📖 Introduction</h2>
<p>
This project focuses on building an intelligent <b>Liver Cirrhosis Stage Detection system</b> using <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</b> and <b>Deep Learning</b> techniques. By leveraging clinical data such as symptoms, medical notes, or patient queries, our system can classify the condition into various stages of liver cirrhosis (e.g., <code>early_stage</code>, <code>mid_stage</code>, <code>end_stage</code>).
</p>

<p>
We fine-tuned the lightweight yet powerful <b>DistilBERT transformer model</b> using the <b>Hugging Face Transformers</b> library to classify intents from medical text. This makes the system highly suitable for integration into <b>healthcare chatbots</b>, <b>telehealth platforms</b>, and <b>diagnostic support tools</b>.
</p>

<p>
The objective is to create a <b>real-time, efficient, and scalable pipeline</b> that empowers healthcare professionals with rapid assessments and improves patient outcomes through timely diagnosis.

<h2>🎯 Core Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To identify the stage of liver cirrhosis based solely on textual/clinical input</li>
  <li>To apply a fine-tuned DistilBERT model for intent classification</li>
  <li>To ensure model efficiency for real-time chatbot or web integration</li>
</ul>

<h2>🧠 Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Python</b> – Core language</li>
  <li><b>Transformers (Hugging Face)</b> – For NLP modeling (DistilBERT)</li>
  <li><b>Scikit-learn</b> – For label encoding, metrics</li>
  <li><b>Pandas & NumPy</b> – Data processing</li>
  <li><b>Google Colab / Jupyter</b> – Development environment</li>
</ul>

<h2>💡 Why This Project Matters</h2>
<p>
Liver cirrhosis is a progressive disease, and misjudging its stage can delay treatment or worsen outcomes. Our model supports faster triage and personalized treatment strategies by making sense of unstructured medical language. It’s a step toward more intelligent and accessible healthcare diagnostics powered by NLP.
